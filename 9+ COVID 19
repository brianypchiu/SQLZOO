1.Introducing the covid table
The example uses a WHERE clause to show the cases in 'Italy' in March.
Modify the query to show data from Spain

Answer:
Select name, DAY(whn), confirmed, deaths, recovered
FROM covid
WHERE name = 'Spain'
AND MONTH(whn) = 3
ORDER BY whn

2.Introducing the LAG function
The LAG function is used to show data from the preceding row or the table. When lining up rows the data is partitioned by country name and ordered by the data whn. That means that only data from Italy is considered.
Modify the query to show confirmed for the day before.

Answer:
SELECT name, DAY(whn), confirmed,
LAG(confirmed, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY name ORDER BY DAY(whn)) as dbf
FROM covid
WHERE name = 'Italy'
AND MONTH(whn) = 3
ORDER BY whn
